  description: 'The Nookipedia API provides endpoints for retrieving *Animal Crossing* data pulled from the [Nookipedia wiki](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Main_Page). A couple of the key benefits of using the Nookipedia API is access to data spanning the entire *Animal Crossing* series, as well as information that is constantly updated and expanding as editors work on the wiki.<br><br>Access to the Nookipedia API requires obtaining a key. This is so we can manage our scale and provide better support for our users. To request access to the API, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/wLwtXLerKhfDrRLY8).'

      description: 'This endpoint retrieves villager information from the entire *Animal Crossing* series, with the option to filter by species, personality, game, and/or birthday. Filters use the AND operator (e.g. asking for villagers who have species `frog` and personality `smug` will return all smug frogs). Note that villagers only include the animals that act as residents. Special characters, such as Tom Nook and Isabelle, are not accessed through this endpoint.'
