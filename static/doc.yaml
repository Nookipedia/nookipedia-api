    The Nookipedia API provides endpoints for retrieving Animal Crossing data
    pulled from the [Nookipedia wiki](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Main_Page). A
    couple of the key benefits of using the Nookipedia API is access to data
    spanning the entire *Animal Crossing* series, as well as information that is
    constantly updated and expanding as editors work on the wiki.<br><br>This
    API launched in July 2020 and is under active development. At the moment, we
    currently have endpoints to retrieve information about *Animal Crossing: New
    Horizons* bugs, fish, and sea creatures. Coming very soon is data on all
    *Animal Crossing* villagers. In the horizon are endpoints for *New Horizons*
    furniture and clothing, as well as critters from previous
    games.<br><br>Access to the Nookipedia API requires obtaining a key. This is
    so we can manage our scale and provide better support for our users. To
    request access to the API, please fill out [this
    form](https://forms.gle/wLwtXLerKhfDrRLY8).<br><br>This API is 'version 2'
    of our [original API](https://nookipedia.com/api/). While the previous API
    scraped information directly from the wiki, this new edition of the API
    pulls data from a structured and constrained database, resulting in
    higher-quality data, better searching, and support for filtering.

            header is required as good practice, but is not currently utilized
            by the API as there is only one version at the moment.

            Retrive only the fish that are available in a specific month. Value
            may be the month's name (`jan`, `january`), the integer representing
            the number (`01`, `1`), or `current` for the current month. When
            `current` is specified, the return body will be an object with two
            arrays inside, one called `north` and the other `south` containing
            the fish available in each respective hemisphere. Note that the
            current month is calculated based off the API server's time, so it
            may be slightly off for you at the beginning or end of the month.
        - in: query

            When set to `true`, only fish names are returned. Instead of an
            array of objects with all details, the return will be an array of
            strings. This is particularly useful when used with the `month`
            filter, for users who want just a list of fish in a given month but
            not all their respective details.

            Note that images can only be reduced in size; specifying a width
            greater than than the maximum size will return the default full-size
            image URL. This parameter is generally not recommended unless you
            absolutely need it, as each returned thumbnail link with a custom
            size requires an additional network call, which can result in a long
            response time if calling this endpoint in between cache refreshes.
